    <!-- Headings define the outline of your web page as both humans and search engines see it,
        which makes selecting relevant headings essential for a high-quality web page. -->
    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>
    
    <!-- whenever you’re not sure about a particular element, 
        do a quick Google search for “MDN <some-element>” -->
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Ordered list makes it easier than manually numbering each list item. --> 
    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li> But, the list item elements are the same </li>
        <li> Also note how the numbers increment on their own </li>
        <li> You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Step-by-step procedures like recipes, instructions, and even tables of contents are good candidates for ordered lists, while <ul> lists are better for representing item inventories, product features, pro/con comparisons, and navigational menus. -->

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <!-- The pseudo-obsolete <b> and <i> elements are classic examples of this. They used to stand for “bold” and “italic”, respectively, but HTML5 attempted to create a clear separation between a document’s structure and its presentation. Thus, <i> was replaced with <em>, since emphasized text can be displayed in all sorts of ways aside from being italicized (e.g., in a different font, a different color, or a bigger size) which’s something for CSS to decide. -->

    <!-- Self closing elements -->
    <!-- HTML condenses consecutive spaces, tabs, or newlines (together known as “whitespace”) into a single space. 
        This behaviour helps the developers keep the line length in the editor variable 
        (instead of one long line) while defining some html.-->
    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading, interneting should be getting easier by now.</p>
    <p>Regards,
    The Authors</p>

    <!-- Use <br> to give a line break betwee two pieces of text, but not to create spacing between two elements or some other purpose. 
    Spacing is part of presentation, and that is meant to be handled by CSS.-->
    <p>Regards again,<br/>
    The Authors</p>

    <!-- The <hr/> element is a “horizontal rule”, which represents a thematic break. The transition from one scene of a story into the next or between the end of a letter and a postscript are good examples of when a horizontal rule may be appropriate. With CSS, we’ll be able to render it as more space between sections, a decorative accent character, or pretty much anything else we want.-->
    <hr/>
    <p>P.S. We will fix this page by using some CSS soon.</p>
    <!-- Like <br/>, <hr/> should carry meaning—don’t use it when you just want to display a line for the sake of aesthetics. For that, you’ll want to use the CSS border property-->

    <!-- Another way to think about the <hr/> element is that it carries less significance than the separation created by a new heading element, but more significance than a new paragraph. -->

    <!-- Can just use <br> and <hr> since the trailing slash is optional for self-closing tags.-->


    <!-- always the first step in the web development process—you need to define what you want to say (HTML) before defining how you want to say it (CSS). -->
